This is generally considered an application logic error, and can happen when a \
reducer assumes it runs in a presentation context. If a reducer can run at \
both the root level of an application, as well as in a presentation \
destination, use dependency('isPresented') to determine if the reducer is \
being presented before calling dependency('dismiss').`,
